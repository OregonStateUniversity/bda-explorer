      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Beaver have long been recognized as a fundamental component of hydrologic, geomorphic, and biotic processes within aquatic systems, and their propensity to build dams alters stream and riparian structure and function to the benefit of an array of aquatic and terrestrial species. The use of beaver dam analogs (BDAs) or structures designed to mimic the form and function of natural beaver dams is increasingly being embraced by restoration practitioners as a cost-effective means to restore stream and riparian function. This site was established to document BDA project locations and facilitate communication among restoration practitioners regarding project outcomes and lessons learned.</p>
